The program defined in this project can be ran in three ways: It can be used as a CLI application It can be used interactively, reading the problem statement from files and running the program specification Or it can be used interactively, passing the problem statement to the relevant functions as an already-parsed data structure. There is a module encapsulating each of these ways of running the program: ExploringMars.CLI defines the CLI application. Running the command mix escript.build at the top-level of this project will generate a binary file named exploring_mars which can be ran on any computer which has an Erlang runtime available. For more information on this CLI app, check the documentation for the ExploringMars.CLI module. ExploringMars.MissionRunner defines the functions which read the input and write the output to files (or to standard input/output). Calling ExploringMars.MissionRunner.get_bounds_and_run/2 passing in input and output files (or :stdio in any of the arguments) will attempt to read in bounds followed by a series of mission specifications (each mission specification consists of an initial position and a series of instructions), outputting the results to the specified output device. Note that this function reads from the input device until it finds EOF, so press Ctrl+D to end the input if reading from :stdio. ExploringMars.Mission defines the functions which take the already-parsed data for a mission and return the result of the mission as an Elixir data structure. Check the module doc for more details.

In that case, we would need to also change the Coordinate module in order to handle the new directions. This coupling between the Direction and Coordinate modules is, for now, acceptable, because the Directions to be handled are few. If we were to choose a case where we would have more possible Directions, it might be worthwhile to create an Axis module which would specify the axes of movement available to the probe, and make both Direction and Coordinate modules depend on the Axis module - the Direction module would produce which axis or axes correspond to each direction, and the Coordinate module would know how to update the coordinate according to motion on each axis.
